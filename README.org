#+TITLE: org-twitter ü¶Ñüê¶

* Introduction
The goal of this package is to reduce the gap between your notes and Twitter; to reduce the friction between spontaneous musings and public tweets. To this end, org-twitter provides a number of functions that transform org-mode notes into tweets, threads, and (soon) even hierarchies of threads on Twitter.
* Dependencies
[[https://github.com/ndwarshuis/org-ml][org-ml]], [[https://github.com/hayamiz/twittering-mode][twittering-mode]], [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-aio][aio]]
* Installation
This package is not yet available on MELPA. However, using [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] to install this package is fairly straightforward:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package org-twitter
  :straight (:host github :repo "ketan0/org-twitter"))
#+end_src

Alternatively, you can manually install the dependencies for this project (listed above,) clone this repo, and drop it in your load path like so:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-twitter")
(require 'org-twitter)
#+end_src
* Usage
With the cursor on an org-mode headline, interactively call =org-twitter-tweet-this-headline= to tweet its contents:
[TODO]

With the cursor on an org-mode parent headline, interactively call =org-twitter-tweet-subheadlines-as-thread= to tweet the content of the child headlines as a thread:
[TODO]

With some text selected, call =org-twitter-tweet-selection=:
[TODO]

To write tweets with org-capture, add something like this to your init file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
             `(("S" "tweet" entry
                ;; change this file as desired
                (file ,(concat org-directory "twitter.org"))
                "* %?")))
(defun my-org-twitter-finalize ()
  (let ((key  (plist-get org-capture-plist :key)))
    (when (and (string= key "S") (not org-note-abort))
      (aio-wait-for (call-interactively 'org-twitter-tweet-this-headline)))))
(add-hook 'org-capture-prepare-finalize-hook 'my-org-twitter-finalize)
#+end_src
